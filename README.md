# NIGERIAN-GRADUATE-OUTLOOK
An empirical analysis of the nigerian graduate report 2018 by suttern and also a logistic regression model to predict whether an individual might get a job after nysc using Sci-kit learn.
This project is rose up due to the passion I had for data science and pattern matching, I was troubled on the rate of unemployment in Nigeria, luckily I just started my journey in data analysis,
and I thought to myself to see if there are chances that data could tell a hidden story behind our unemployment. Yes it did, and the results from the analysis were all correct and true.
