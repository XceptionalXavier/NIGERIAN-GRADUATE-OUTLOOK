# NIGERIAN-GRADUATE-OUTLOOK
Using Sci-kit learn, an empirical examination of the nigerian graduation report 2018 by suttern and a logistic regression model to predict whether a person would find work after his or her mandated service to the country soon after college.
## About the Project
This project came about as a result of my enthusiasm for data science and pattern matching; I was worried by the high rate of unemployment in Nigeria, and I wondered whether statistics might reveal a hidden tale about our unemployment and my prospects of finding work after graduation. Yes, it did, and the analysis's findings were all accurate and truthful.
Additionally, I developed a predictive model that may forecast whether a student would find work after graduation based on a variety of occupational factors. While the model received an 80% confidence level, the categorization report revealed the model's inaccuracy. On second thinking, it is not a mistake; rather, it demonstrates how slim the odds of finding work after graduation are in Nigeria.
