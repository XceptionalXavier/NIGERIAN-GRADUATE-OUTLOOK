# NIGERIAN-GRADUATE-OUTLOOK
An empirical analysis of the nigerian graduate report 2018 by suttern and also a logistic regression model to predict whether an individual might get a job after the mandatory service to the nation immediately after college using Sci-kit learn.
This project rose up due to the passion I had for data science and pattern matching, I was troubled on the rate of unemployment in Nigeria, luckily I just started my journey in data analysis,
and I thought to myself to see if there are chances that data could tell a hidden story behind our unemployment and my chances of getting a job after college. Yes it did, and the results from the analysis were all correct and true.
I also built a predicitve model that could tell if a student will get a job after college based on his selections.  Yes, the model got an 80% confidence, but you could tell the error in the model by looking at the classification report. On a second thought, that is not an error, it just shows that the chances of getting a job after college is very thin.
